# Lab0x04

This file was built and run in Microsoft Visual Studio 19

I will upload the file so that when it runs, it default prints the chart to one algorithm.  The other two will be commented out in the main method next to the currently run algorithm.

There is also a commented section called "testing." This is the section that contains the code that tests that the algorithms are operating properly.

The variables can be adjusted here to change the length of the list, the max value, and the number of forced triplets.
